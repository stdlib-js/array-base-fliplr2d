    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

## Usage

```javascript
import fliplr2d from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/array-base-fliplr2d@v0.2.2-deno/mod.js';
```

#### fliplr2d( x )

Reverses the order of elements along the last dimension of a two-dimensional nested input array.

```javascript
var out = fliplr2d( [ [ 1, 2 ], [ 3, 4 ] ] );
// returns [ [ 2, 1 ], [ 4, 3 ] ]
